üêõ Insect Detection in Agricultural Fields using Image Processing & Machine Learning
This project aims to detect the presence of insects in agricultural fields using a collection of images as input data. By leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes each image to determine whether insects are present in a particular area.

The main goal is to assist farmers and agricultural researchers in identifying pest-prone areas early, enabling timely and targeted pest control measures. This not only helps in reducing crop loss but also minimizes the excessive use of pesticides, promoting more sustainable farming practices.

Key Highlights:

Dataset of agricultural field images labeled with insect presence.

Preprocessing techniques applied for noise removal and clarity enhancement.

Image classification model trained to detect insects accurately.

Output indicates whether an insect is detected in a specific area.

This solution can be integrated into larger smart agriculture systems for real-time pest monitoring and precision farming.
